# BlazorDemo

This is my simple Blazor application that demonstrates how to build SPA on Blazor and how to communicate with ASP.NET Core backend. 
Demo application is simple books database. 

Solution contains:

* Sample database BACPAC file (can be imported to MSSQL using SSMS)
* Client application with Blazor UI
* Basic select and CRUD operations are implemented in UI and in back-end
* Displaying of delete confirmation dialog and deleting of books
* Fully functioning add/edit form
* Pager component and support for data paging
* Dependency injection with custom service classes

## Tools

As of 2018-05-09 the following tooling is needed to build Blazor applications:

* [.NET Core 2.1 Preview 2 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/sdk-2.1.300-preview2)
* [Preview version of Visual Studio 2017 (15.7)](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/preview/)
* ASP.NET and web development workload for Visual Studio (activate during VS installation)
* [ASP.NET Core Blazor Language Services extension](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=870389)
